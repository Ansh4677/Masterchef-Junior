Chicken Momos is a popular street food in India but its roots are from Tibet and Bhutan. This dish is also very similar to dumplings from China. And also believed to have spread from China through caravan routes connecting the Central Asian steppe to both East and West.

Momos are made by steam cooking chicken stuffing wrapped in wheat or all-purpose flour dough. In this recipe, I have used all-purpose flour/ maida but for a healthier choice, you can switch to wheat flour.

There are many variations to momos like schezwan momos, fried momos, and veg momos. But traditional momos are plain and steam cooked.

Momos are usually served with the popular red momos chutney and white sauce.


How to cook chicken momos
Step 1: Making the dough
In a bowl add maida and salt. Mix it.
Then, add water in small quantities and knead the dough. Once it forms a whole round ball of dough, knead it for 2 more minutes.
Now cover the dough with a damp cloth and rest it for 10 minutes
Step 2: Stuffing

In a bowl add the minced chicken(boil some chicken pieces and grind it to form a coarse paste or use raw chicken, mince it and add it to the stuffing)
Next, add pepper, salt, onion, ginger garlic paste, and coriander leaves.
Mix it all well and keep it aside
Step 3: Pressing the dough

Take the resting dough and roll it into long cylindrical form. Now cut them into equal pieces and keep it aside
Now, take one of the pieces and roll it with the use of a rolling pin.
Roll all the pieces and keep it aside.
Now, take one of the pieces and use a round mold to make a neat round shape.
Do the same for the rest of the pieces. Keep it aside
Step 4: Making momos

Take one of the pressed and round shape dough. Place a small ball of stuffing in the dough.
Now seal the ends of the dough using pleating method or use a folk and press the two ends together.
Do the same for the rest of the dough and stuffing

Step 5: Steaming the momos

Next, take a steamer and fill some water to it and bring it to boil. Now place the momos on the plate given in the steamer.
Now, close the steamer and let it cook for 5 to 7 minutes
After 7 minutes, switch off the flame and removes the cooked momos from the steamer.
